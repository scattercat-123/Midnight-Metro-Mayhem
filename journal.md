Texture packer gu i is rlly gud cause it lets you use regions

## day 4:
tilemap and teilsets weere really hard..
i dint understand how to make one way collision blocks untill i found a really good reddit post!
so basically you had to go and select each tile and then put polygons 0: one way collsion.

the whole day i spent making collision and one way cause there weere like 100 tilesets from the asset i used.

## day 5 - 6:
